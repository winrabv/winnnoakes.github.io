									<h2><a >Jewellery Sales Data Analysis<br />
									</a></h2>
									
									<p><ul>In this project, I used and analysed the sales data from my jewellery <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/LNhandmadejewellery?ref=seller-platform-mcnav">Etsy shop,</a>
									 covering the years 2020 to 2023. Despite ceasing operations in 2023, I aimed to identify the year with the highest sales volume and determine the top ten best-selling items.</ul>

							</a></h2>
							<p><ul>The raw sales data from Etsy were messy and unorganized, as seen in the image titled "From raw messy data." I utilised Excel to process and clean the data. There were 12 Excel files, each containing over 350 rows. I combined the data to create a new, consolidated dataset for better visualisation. The image titled "To clean data" shows the processed and cleaned data, transformed into a table for more effective analysis and improved clarity.</ul>

								</ul>	
								</a></h2>		
							<p><ul>During the cleaning process, I extensively utilised the VLOOKUP function to combine and consolidate the dataset. This function was instrumental in matching and merging data from different files based on common key fields. By using VLOOKUP, I ensured that related information from the 12 separate Excel files, each containing over 350 rows, was accurately integrated into a single, cohesive dataset. This method streamlined the data consolidation process, reducing errors and enhancing the overall data integrity. The result is a well-organised and comprehensive dataset, ready for further analysis and visualisation.</ul>

								</a></h2>		
							<p><ul>After processing the data in Excel, I created pivot tables to summarize and analyse the data before moving on to visualisation. These pivot tables provided a clear and concise way to view aggregated information, enabling me to identify key patterns and trends.</ul>

								To enhance understanding and clarity, I utilised charts with slicers. Slicers allowed for interactive filtering, making it easier to explore the data from different perspectives. The charts highlighted the best-selling items, and slicers were used to filter data by specific items and time periods.

						<p>
							<ul>I imported the Excel file into Power Query for further processing and cleaning, which involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. I then standardised the data by converting text cases, splitting and merging columns, and reorganizing it into structured tables with established relationships and aggregated key metrics.</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>After preparing the data in Power Query, I loaded it into Power BI. There, I formatted the data for readability, applied conditional formatting, and normalised it for consistency.</ul>
						</p>
						<p>	
						<ul>Finally, I conducted thorough checks to ensure data accuracy and reliability, verifying all transformations and calculations. This comprehensive process resulted in clean, well-structured data, ready for detailed analysis and visualisation.</ul>

					<p><ul>Designing a Star Schema:
						To optimise query performance and reporting, I implemented a star schema. The Sales Data table served as the central fact table, surrounded by dimension tables for Buyer, Payments, and Customer Reviews. Each dimension table contained unique keys and relevant attributes to support detailed analysis.</ul>

				<p><ul>Final Sales Dashboard Created: Here is an overview of LN Jewellery’s sparkling sales from 2020 to 2023.</ul>
					<p><ul>In 2020, a jewellery brand started its journey in the fashion world. Over the next few years, the brand won many hearts, selling a total of 505 pieces and earning £3,700 in gross sales. The year 2021 was a highlight, with the highest sales volume recorded. This boost in sales suggested that the brand’s marketing strategies and new designs were very successful.</ul>
					<p><ul>Among all the jewellery pieces, the Bee Earrings were the bestsellers. Their unique design and charm made them a favourite among customers. The Anxiety Relief Necklace and Silver Heart Earrings were also top sellers, showing what customers liked best and helping the brand plan future collections.</ul></p>
					<p><ul>Most sales, about 98%, were in the United Kingdom, showing a strong local market. However, 2% of sales came from the United States, hinting at growth opportunities there. Customer reviews were very positive, with most giving 4 and 5-star ratings. This feedback showed that customers were happy with the quality and experience of the products.</ul></p>
					<p><ul>If the brand had continued operations, with these insights, they could have looked to new opportunities. Expanding their market in the US would be a priority. They would also need to keep promoting their popular items like the Bee Earrings. Using the positive customer reviews in their marketing would help attract new customers and boost their reputation.</ul></p>
					<p><ul>In conclusion, 2021 was the year the jewellery brand experienced notable success. Their strong performance in the UK and high customer satisfaction set the stage for a bright future. By focusing on these insights and exploring new market opportunities, the brand could have been ready to continue its growth and success.</ul></p>
